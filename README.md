cv-personal-site-exercise ðŸ“„âœ¨

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This repository contains one of my very first web development projects, an exercise created during my university studies to learn the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. The main goal was to build a simple personal website, practicing content structure and basic style application.

This project represents an important starting point in my journey as a developer, showcasing my initial interaction and learning with essential web technologies.

Website Features ðŸŒŸ
This small website includes the following sections:

Main Page (index.html): Presents a brief introduction about me, my role as founder and CTO of App Abundance, and my educational background.
My Hobbies (hobbies.html): A page dedicated to my personal interests.
Contact Me (contact-me.html): A section with my contact details and a basic form for sending messages.
Technologies and Skills Applied ðŸ“š
Though an initial exercise, it allowed me to apply and become familiar with:

HTML: For the fundamental structure and organization of all page content.
CSS: For applying basic styles, such as background color and element spacing, giving it a simple yet functional appearance.
